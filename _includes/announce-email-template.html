Announcing that the {{include.longname}} committers have voted to retire
the project due to inactivity. {{include.description}}.

Retiring a project is not as simple as turning everything off, as
existing users need to both know that the project is retiring and
retain access to the necessary information for their own development
efforts.

You can read more about {{include.name}}'s retirement at:

   https://attic.apache.org/projects/{{include.project_id}}.html

The project's resources will continue to be available in a read-only state -
website, mailing lists, wikis, git, downloads and bug tracker with no 
change in url.

Providing process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache
project has reached its end of life is the role of the Apache Attic,
and you can read more about that at:

   https://attic.apache.org/

Thanks,

${NAME}
on behalf of the Apache Attic and the now retired {{include.name}} project
