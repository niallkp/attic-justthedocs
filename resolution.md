# Board Resolution to move to the Attic
***

The following is a sample resolution to move a project to the Apache Attic.
A project's chair should include this in the agenda for the next board meeting:

```
   ?.  Terminate the Apache {PROJECT} Project

       WHEREAS, the Project Management Committee of the Apache {PROJECT}
       project has chosen by vote to recommend moving the project to the
       Attic; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it no longer in the best
       interest of the Foundation to continue the Apache {PROJECT} project
       due to inactivity;

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Apache {PROJECT}
       project is hereby terminated; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Attic PMC be and hereby is tasked with
       oversight over the software developed by the Apache {PROJECT}
       Project; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Apache {PROJECT}" is
       hereby terminated; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Apache {PROJECT} PMC is hereby terminated.
```
