project_description: >-
    Savan/Java was a Java implementation of WS-Eventing specification.
    Savan/Java was built on top of Axis2/Java. Therefore by using Savan/Java
    you could add WS-Eventing capability to Web services hosted using Axis2/Java.
    Savan/Java was designed as a general publisher/subscriber tool. The
    arcitecture was designed to abstract the general publisher/subscriber
    features so that people could support more than one publisher/subscriber
    mechanisms within the same infrastructure.
