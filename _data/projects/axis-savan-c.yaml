project_description: >-
    Savan/C was a C implementation of WS-Eventing specification. Savan/C was
    built on top of Axis2/C. Therefore by using Savan/C you could add
    WS-Eventing capability to Web services hosted using Axis2/C. 
    Savan/C was designed as a general publisher/subscriber tool. The 
    arcitecture was designed to abstract the general publisher/subscriber
    features so: that people could support more than one publisher/subscriber
    mechanisms within the same infrastructure.
