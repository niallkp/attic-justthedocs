     Quetzalcoatl, or Quetz as it was more commonly known, was a project charged
     with the creation and maintenance of open-source software related to mod_python
     and the Python programming language. Mainly formed around the mod_python
     subproject, it didn't have activity in the mod_python community to drive the
     larger project along.
